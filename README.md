# Artboard Automargin

> Warning: this plugin contains a pretty nasty bug with Undo, please donâ€™t use it by now ðŸ˜…

## What is this?

This plugin will adjust the X position and width of any object dragged into an Artboard, so that they expand to take the full width of the Artboard, minus a specified margin (see Artboard Automargin â€º Settingsâ€¦ to adjust it).

You can disable the behaviour for any layer or Artboard by prefixing their names with `--`. As a convenience, there are two menu items ("Exclude Selection" and "Include Selection") that add and remove the prefix automatically for the selected layers.

## Roadmap

- Add a proper Settings panel
- Add the ability to exclude Layers and Artboards without renaming them
- Add other fancy resizing and positioning behaviours

## Installation

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/artboard-automargin.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
